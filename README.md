# UofT Utils
These are some small CLI scripts I created for my personal use to make some simple tasks easier during my time at UofT FASE.<br>

### update_courses_ics.py
A small script to read and update the courses.ics file provided by U of T to remove alarms and customize the events.
<br>
### grade_metrics_calculator.py
A calculator for some metrics based on university grades, notably:<br>
- CGPA (Cumulative GPA over all courses)
- Average (Cumulative Average over all courses)
- Average for Honours (Cumulative Average from second year onwards)
<br><br>
Note: This was developed for personal speculative use only.
<br>
### Other Files
grades.txt is an example of the expected input for grade_metrics_calculator. This can be created by copying results from a transcript.
